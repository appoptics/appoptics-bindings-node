1. use N-API (don't need to compile for supported environments)
2. remove all friend classes
3. convert classes with only static methods to namespaces.
4. Metadata
  - remove methods getMetadataData, copy, createEvent
5. Event
  - remove getEventData
6. OboeContext => namespace.
  - removed copy, startTrace.
  - added getTraceSettings
7. Reporter => namespace.
8. Utility (removed class).
9. Config => namespace.
  - removed getRevision, getVersion, checkVersion.
10. Sanitizer => namespace.
11. removed download capability in setup-liboboe (package dependencies went from 50 => 3)
12. added prepack script (one build fits all).
13. cleaned up compile-time dependencies (moved node-gyp and node-addon-api to devDependencies)


build system dependency notes
- catalog changes at class/function level
- alpine 3.4.6 doesn't run bindings as built - __printf_chk: symbol not found
- debian 8 doesn't run bindings as built - GLIBCXX_3.4.21 not found
-  (looks like maybe will run if built with GLIBCXX_3.4.)
-  Debian 8 has GLIBC "2.19-18+deb8u10", 2014 compiled by GNU CC 4.8.4.
- appoptics-bindings.node built on debian runs on alpine, debian, ubuntu
- appoptics-bindings.node built on alpine does not run on debian (links to musl)
-> production build process should build in a debian container.

pending
- remove sampleTrace once the N-API/oboe 3.4.0+ version is released.
- combine context and metadata completely
- consider holding context buffer in cls?
